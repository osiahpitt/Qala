# QALA Commit Strategy

## 🎯 Commit Philosophy
Make commits **often** and **descriptive** for future developers to understand the evolution of the codebase.

## 📋 Commit Frequency Rules
- ✅ **After completing any feature component** (signup form, auth page, etc.)
- ✅ **After fixing bugs or TypeScript errors**
- ✅ **After adding tests or documentation**
- ✅ **Before switching to a new major task**
- ✅ **At end of each development session**

## 📝 Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.
Include any breaking changes or important notes.

- List specific changes made
- Reference any issues or requirements addressed
- Note any dependencies or setup required
